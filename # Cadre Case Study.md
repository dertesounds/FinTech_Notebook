## **Business Activites**:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    ***Many investors are losing opportunities to partake in the the real estate game because of barriers to entry. Most notably because of minimum capital requirements being too high. Cadre was birthed to give investors opportunity to real estate markets so that they can create wealth over time. It is an investment platoform that connects these investors to operators such as property managers and sponsors***



* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)


    ***Cadre focuses on the average working class individual. No other company has made real estate investing their main goal, while creating a platform that targets these specific targets, so Cadre exist in a unique space. What seperates Cadre from compititors is support and sponsorship with major financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs and blackstone.***

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


    ***Cadre is written in the Django application, which is a Python framework. They also run all their software under Amazon Web Services (AWS). Cadre uses machine learning to target real estate markets. It collects data based on demographics, local business data, and other alternarive data sets. This technology specifically is used to help customers make intelligent decisions when deciding to invest their capital.***

    ***The company has definitely been successful. It boast a $800 million dollar valuation. Manages abou 1 billion dollars worth of real estate and in additionhas financed up to 3.1 billion dollars worth of property deals.***



* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    ***I believe Cadre's main core metrics are based on customer acquition and revenues both for the investors and the company itself. In terms of performance Cadre is performing very well based on these metrics. As stated previously they manage $1 billion dollars worth of capital. With continued support from various institutions they are bound to grow.***

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    ***Cadre is deifinetley ahead of the curve in this domain. Mainly because of their early inception. This is because their customer base is much larger than other companies since it has less barriers of entry. For example as of September 21, 2020 investors who use their Cadre Cash saving deposits can earn a guaranteed 3% on retunrs if held for a 12 month period. This interest rate higher than all domains in this space and even higher than some banks especially in the covid economic environment.***

## **Recommendations**:

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    ***I would recommend implementing some type of social media aspect to the platform to build a sense of community. possibly money pools or even as simple as group messaging so that investors are contiously using  using the platform for information on better deals.***

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 
    
    ***Once you build a communitym you build conversation. There are not many platforms that focus on social media in the investment area. This would be the perfect opportunity to be the twitter of the real estate investing world.***

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    ***I definitely would use api to draw information from various financial outlets and sources. We would of course need to use big data for storage of conversations and favorite posts. This would also be used to track the trending topics and hot coonversations on the platform.***

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    ***These technologies have already proven to propell social media platforms such as twitter, facebook, and instagram. Cadre doesn't need to reinvent the wheel because they already exist in a unique market.***
